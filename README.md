## Security Vulnerability Reporting
This project supports security researchers' rights to test software / libraries / products for vulnerabilities and advocates for responsible disclosure. 

If you do discover a security issue / vulnerability in this project please get in touch by emailing alex.hague [at] awsGunForHire [dot] com. 

**I guarantee that a sensible discussion will take** place focused on improving the security of this library and providing attribution to the researcher (*rather than the threats and a flame war that some companies seem to prefer!?*).
